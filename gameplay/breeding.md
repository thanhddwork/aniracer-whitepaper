# Breeding

Like real-world pets, Aniracer can be bred to create new offspring. To avoid hyperinflation of Aniracer there is a maximum amount of times an Aniracer can be bred before it is sterile.

Breeding will costs AAG and ANP depending on how many times the Aniracer have been bred and which rarity Aniracer is.

Once the Breeding Process is successfully, Player will need to wait some days for Aniracer to grow up and experience full game features.

# Renting

There are three modes of renting inside the Aniracer game. These are **Pay Fee Renting**, **Profit Share** and **Direct Rental.**

* **Pay Fee Renting**
  * In this mode, an Aniracer Owner simply puts his Aniracer onto the Rental Marketplace for a fixed price and an amount of time, for example 100 AAG and 2 days. In return, the Renter will receive the Aniracer for 2 days.  Once the renter has paid the fee and accept the agreement, the owner will receive fee 100 AAG above from the renter. Owner will not be able to "take back" Aniracer for the full 2 days, guaranteeing the renters can use Aniracer for the fixed rental period.
* **Profit Share**
  * In this mode, you can set the % profit split they wish to provide to the Renter and hit "List to Rental Marketplace" where anyone is able to see your listing Pega. Renter can choose Aniracer from the Rental Marketplace. Once finish choosing, Renter need to accept the agreement from the marketplace, the Owner is able to "take back" the Aniracer at any time. Sometimes the Renter may be too busy to achieve to the Owner standards, and the Owner would prefer to find someone else in the market willing to work harder.&#x20;
* **Direct Rental**
  * Direct Rental allows Owner to create a rental contract which they then send directly to the Renter for them to accept. Additionally, Owner can change their % share profit even when ongoing contract.&#x20;

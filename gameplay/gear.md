# Gear



Having gear is the best way to unlock new skills and adding more attributes to your Aniracer. Each gear will have different rarity and stats. Players can get gear by crafting gear from fragments or getting it from lootbox, or buying directly from marketplace. Gear can also be upgraded to unlock its potential. Gear will need to repair after its durability reduced to 0.

# Marketplace

### Buying

If you wish to buy an Aniracer or gear, Marketplace is the best place to go. All you need is go to Marketplace Website, choose your favorite Aniracer by using approriate filter then simply click "Buy". From here, Metamask or other associated wallets will display a pop-up to confirm the transaction, once approved your purchase is complete.

### Selling

There are two methods of listing to sell inside the Aniracer marketplace, these are:

* **List to Buy Now**
  * The **List to Buy Now** method is your typical marketplace sale. Simply list your Aniracer with the price you wish to sell it for. if someone is willing to pay the price you listed, the transaction will proceed and you will sell your NFT and received the payment.\

* **Auction**
  * The second method that we have introduced is an Auction. With this, you are able to simply  place your Aniracer up for Auction with a reserve price. Once it hits the market, users are able to place bids on your NFT. If the reserve price is met, the Auction will continue until the timer ends. Users always can place higher bid to win the auction before the timers ends. If the price has met Bid's owner expectation, Owner can even end auction by yourself immediately.
